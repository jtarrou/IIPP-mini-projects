IIPP-mini-projects
==================

projects for the Coursera IIPP course

Rice University's Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python is a really great course.

It is fun and informative and you can tell the professors love teaching the course. It is a little work-intensive if you are busy and taking other courses and have kids, etc. as I do, but it is worth it.

Course consists of 8 weeks, 2 quizzes per week and one mini-project per week.

Very rewarding.
